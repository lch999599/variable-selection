# CMPT 419/726: Machine Learning Course Project

Python implementation for the machine learning course project titled "Variable Selection for Branching in Mixed Integer Linear Programming"

## Getting Started

The implementation uses Python 2.7 along with CPLEX 12.8.

### Prerequisites
* Python 2.7
* CPLEX 12.8
	* Please follow the instructions [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSSA5P_12.6.2/ilog.odms.studio.help/Optimization_Studio/topics/COS_installing.html)
* Install Python API for CPLEX 12.8
	* The Python API for CPLEX need to be installed separately. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSSA5P_12.8.0/ilog.odms.cplex.help/CPLEX/GettingStarted/topics/set_up/Python_setup.html)
